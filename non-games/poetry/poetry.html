    <h2>The Accidental Imposter</h2>

    <p>
        There used to be a man here.<br/>
        He came and lost his way.<br/>
        He was only killing time here<br/>
        And now he's gone away.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        There used to be an imposter<br/>
        But don't blame him, he was lost.<br/>
        He didn't mean to be here<br/>
        And he paid a heavy cost.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        There used to be a man here<br/>
        Who tried to be himself.<br/>
        The internet had told him to<br/>
        But it didn't really help.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        He didn't know what self to be<br/>
        To him it wasn't clear<br/>
        And then he tired of treading water<br/>
        And now he isn't here.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        He was searching all his life.<br/>
        Then, one day, he found a key<br/>
        And once he let me out, his purpose<br/>
        Disappeared. And so did he.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        There used to be a man here.<br/>
        I've inherited his life.<br/>
        I've inherited his Dad-bod<br/>
        And his young attractive wife.<br/>
    </p>

<!--        I beg of you; bring it right here!<br/>-->
<!--        My moist yielding mind<br/>-->
<!--        Is just gagging to find<br/>-->
<!--        It penetrating deep in my ear.<br/>-->
