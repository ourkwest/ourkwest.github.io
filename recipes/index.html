    <h2>Cheese & Chili Shorties</h2>

    <p>
        <img src="baked.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        I've adapted this from a recipe my mother gave me. I used to love these as a child.
        I added the warming afterglow of chili and some seeds that I had in the house.
        I made this for my colleagues at work and they couldn't stop telling me how nice they were.
        So here's the recipe.
        I used a fairly ordinary supermarket-grade chili, and that seemed to work pretty well.
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz. Plain Flour</li>
            <li>6 oz. Butter</li>
            <li>6 oz. Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Cream (optional)</li>
            <li>1 De-seeded & Finely Chopped Chili Pepper</li>
            <li>Black Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Assorted seeds (I used a mix of sesame, onion, poppy and linseed - roughly a heaped teaspoon of each. But any small tasty seeds would probably work)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients except the seeds and knead into a smooth dough.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="dough.jpg"/>
            </p>

            <li>Roll out to roughly 1/4 inch thick and cut into shapes.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="cutting.jpg"/>
            </p>

            <li>Pour the assorted seeds onto a plate and press one side of each shape into the seeds.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="pressing.jpg"/>
            </p>

            <li>Place on a baking tray seedy side up. (Baking paper may help with removing them afterwards.)</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes at 190 &deg;C.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="final.jpg"/>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <div>Known issues:
            <ul>
                <li>Don't overcook them - take them out of the oven when they look tasty.</li>
                <li>If the dough is too hard/dry then persuading the seeds to stick may be an uphill struggle.
                    A light egg wash on the top before pressing them into the seeds will solve this.</li>
                <li>If you're short for time, or just aggressively prioritising,
                    you can mix the seeds into the dough before baking
                    instead of pressing them into the tops of the biscuits.
                    They still comes out just as tasty.</li>

    <p>
        Well, it's <i>my</i> ultimate bacon buttie, YMMV.
        I find the sweetness of the banana and basil work really well with the bacon.
