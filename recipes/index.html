<h2>Cheese & Chili Shorties</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
    I've adapted this from a recipe my mother gave me. I used to love these as a child.
    I added the warming afterglow of chili and some seeds that I had in the house.
    I made this for my colleagues at work and they couldn't stop telling me how nice they were.
    So here's the recipe.
    I used a fairly ordinary supermarket-grade chili, and that seemed to work pretty well.
</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>6 oz. Plain Flour</li>
        <li>6 oz. Butter</li>
        <li>6 oz. Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Cream</li>
        <li>1 De-seeded & Finely Chopped Chili Pepper</li>
        <li>Black Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Assorted seeds (I used a mix of sesame, onion, poppy and linseed - roughly a heaped teaspoon of each.)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients except the seeds and knead into a smooth dough.</li>
        <p>
            <img src="dough.jpg"/>
        </p>

        <li>Roll out to roughly 1/4 inch thick and cut into shapes.</li>
        <p>
            <img src="cutting.jpg"/>
        </p>

        <li>Pour the assorted seeds onto a plate and press one side of each shape into the seeds.</li>
        <p>
            <img src="pressing.jpg"/>
        </p>

        <li>Place on a baking tray seedy side up. (Baking paper may help with removing them afterwards.)</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes at 190 &deg;C.</li>
        <p>

<h2>Ultimate Bacon Buttie</h2>

<p>
    Well, it's <i>my</i> ultimate bacon buttie, YMMV.
    I find the sweetness of the banana and basil work really well with the bacon.
</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon (obvs.)</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/asyoulikeit/index.html">as you like it</a>.</li>
        <li>Fry the banana until soft and squishy.</li>
        <li>Toast the bread and butter it.</li>
        <li>Assemble!</li>
    </ol>
