    <h2>Flapjack</h2>

    <p>
        <img src="seedy_flapjack.jpg"/>
    </p>

    <div>

        <ul>
            <li>250g Butter</li>
            <li>250g Golden/Light Brown Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>5/6 tablespoons of Honey or Golden Syrup</li>
            <li>400g Rolled Oats</li>
            <li>100g Assorted Seeds & Nuts (for example: quinoa, sesame, pumpkin, cashew pieces)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt the butter, and stir in the sugar until it is dissolved. One reliable way to melt the butter is to
                add it to a heatproof bowl and sit it on top of a saucepan (as if it were the lid) with a little
                boiling water underneath on a low heat. The bowl should not be touching the water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the Honey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the butter and sugar from the heat and stir in the seeds & nuts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread out on an oven tray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for about 15-25 minutes at 180 &deg;C in a fan oven. Look for it starting to brown rather than the
                consistency, as it will still be quite runny at that temperature even when it is finished cooking.

    <h2>Walnut Balls</h2>

    <p>
        Someone gave me some walnuts!
        So I made these:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="walnutBalls/readyToGo.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <div>

        <ul>
            <li>A bunch of Walnuts (enough to get a good walnutty taste)</li>
            <li>Some Dates (enough to bind the other ingredients)</li>
            <li>A squirt of Agave Syrup (enough to stop the mixture being dry)</li>
            <li>A handful of Toasted Pumpkin and Sunflower Seeds</li>
            <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
            <li>A bowl of Dessicated Coconut (enough to cover the balls)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Shell the walnuts.
                If you don't have a nut cracker (I didn't) then either buy one, or hit the nuts with something.
                I used a rolling pin.
                Short sharp whacks worked best, but I still ended up with the odd walnut that exploded fragments across the kitchen.
                I shall be picking up the shards for weeks.
                Safety goggles or a lax attitude are advised.
                <p><img src="walnutBalls/death_to_walnuts.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients in a bladed mixer until about as smooth as you like.
                Maybe you like some texture, maybe you don't?
                <p><img src="walnutBalls/premix.jpg"/></p>
                <p><img src="walnutBalls/postmix.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Roll into small balls (about the size you could comfortably fit one in your mouth).
                Roll them in <s>desecrated</s> <s>deprecated</s> <s>decimated</s> dessicated coconut.
                <p><img src="walnutBalls/rolling.jpg"/></p>

    <h2>Cheese & Chili Shorties</h2>

    <p>
        Based on a recipe my mother gave me. I used to love these as a child.
        Whenever I bake them someone asks for the recipe, so here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="baked.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Basic Recipe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz. Plain Flour</li>
            <li>6 oz. Butter</li>
            <li>6 oz. Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients by hand and work into a smooth dough.
                If the dough is too dry to work easily then adding in a tablespoon of cream will help.
                If the dough is too wet, add more flour.
                <p><img src="dough.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Roll out to roughly 1/4 inch thick and cut into shapes.
                Use a dusting of flour to help it not stick to the work surface and rolling pin.
                <p><img src="cutting.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Place on a baking tray. (Baking paper may help with removing them afterwards.)</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 190 &deg;C. Take them out when they look tasty and are slightly
                starting to brown on top.
                <p><img src="final.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to make them interesting...</h3>
        <p>I often do one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a de-seeded & finely chopped chili pepper to the mixture
                (you can see the red flecks in the pictures above).
                Adding flour will compensate for the extra moisture if the dough becomes too sticky.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of ground cayenne pepper. Or a couple of teaspoons full! :-D</li>
            <li>Add a few grinds of black pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix in some assorted small seeds, such as sesame, linseed, poppy ot onion seeds.</li>
            <li>Press some seeds onto the top of the biscuits before baking (as pictured) - if the
                dough is dry and they won't stick then a light egg wash will help them to stay in place.

    <p>
        Well, it's <i>my</i> ultimate bacon buttie, YMMV.
        I find the sweetness of the banana and basil work really well with the bacon.

    <h2>Chocolate Brownie</h2>

    <p>
        Adapted from <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-ever-chocolate-brownies-recipe">a recipe on the
        BBC good food website</a>. In my opinion they make the recipe seem unnecessarily long and complicated, but if I've
        over-simplified then you can check the source for more detail.
    </p>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>180g (2 bars) Green & Blacks 70% dark chocolate (or equivalent)</li>
            <li>180g Butter</li>
            <li>275g Light brown/golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>85g plain flour (for nut-free) or ground almonds (for gluten-free)</li>
            <li>100g white chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter and chocolate together. I usually do this in a glass bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs and sugar until thick and creamy looking. 3-8 minutes with an electric whisk.</li>
            <li>Once the chocolate has cooled a bit fold it into the eggs along with the remaining ingredients.
                If using flour, passing it through a sieve a bit at a time will help to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>Bake in a lined ~20cm square tin for about 30 minutes at 160 &deg;C in a fan oven.</li>
