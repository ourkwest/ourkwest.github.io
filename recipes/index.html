    <h2>Walnut Balls</h2>

    <p>
        Someone gave me some walnuts!
        So I made these:
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A bunch of Walnuts (enough to get a good walnutty taste)</li>
            <li>Some Dates (enough to bind the other ingredients)</li>
            <li>A squirt of Agave Syrup (enough to stop the mixture being dry)</li>
            <li>A handful of Toasted Pumpkin and Sunflower Seeds</li>
            <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
            <li>A bowl of Dessicated Coconut (enough to cover the balls)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Shell the walnuts.
                If you don't have a nut cracker (I didn't) then either buy one, or hit the nuts with something.
                I used a rolling pin.
                Short sharp whacks worked best, but I still ended up with the odd walnut that exploded fragments across the kitchen.
                I shall be picking up the shards for weeks.
                Safety goggles or a lax attitude are advised.

            </li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients in a bladed mixer until about as smooth as you like.
                Maybe you like some texture, maybe you don't?

                <p><img src="walnutBalls/postmix.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Roll into small balls (about the size you could comfortably fit one in your mouth).
                Roll them in <s>desecrated</s> <s>deprecated</s> <s>decimated</s> dessicated coconut.
                <p><img src="walnutBalls/rolling.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

    <h2>Cheese & Chili Shorties</h2>

    <p>
        Based on a recipe my mother gave me. I used to love these as a child.
        Whenever I bake them someone asks for the recipe, so here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="baked.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Basic Recipe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz. Plain Flour</li>
            <li>6 oz. Butter</li>
            <li>6 oz. Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients by hand and work into a smooth dough.
                If the dough is too dry to work easily then adding in a tablespoon of cream will help.
                If the dough is too wet, add more flour.
                <p><img src="dough.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Roll out to roughly 1/4 inch thick and cut into shapes.
                Use a dusting of flour to help it not stick to the work surface and rolling pin.
                <p><img src="cutting.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>Place on a baking tray. (Baking paper may help with removing them afterwards.)</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 190 &deg;C. Take them out when they look tasty and are slightly
                starting to brown on top.
                <p><img src="final.jpg"/></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to make them interesting...</h3>
        <p>I often do one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a de-seeded & finely chopped chili pepper to the mixture
                (you can see the red flecks in the pictures above).
                Adding flour will compensate for the extra moisture if the dough becomes too sticky.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of ground cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li>Add a few grinds of black pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix in some assorted small seeds, such as sesame, linseed, poppy ot onion seeds.</li>
            <li>Press some seeds onto the top of the biscuits before baking (as pictured) - if the
                dough is dry and they won't stick then a light egg wash will help them to stay in place.

    <p>
        Well, it's <i>my</i> ultimate bacon buttie, YMMV.
        I find the sweetness of the banana and basil work really well with the bacon.

            <li>Bacon (obvs.)</li>
            <li>Bread</li>

            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the bacon <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/asyoulikeit/index.html">as you like it</a>.</li>
            <li>Fry the banana until soft and squishy.</li>
