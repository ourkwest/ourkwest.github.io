            I wrote this in ClojureScript as I wanted an excuse to play with the language.
            I was amazed at how like Clojure it is (apart from the host language interop. and the runtime they're basically identical.)

            I wrote this some years ago as a Java applet (back when Java applets were still a thing).
            There are no dependencies beyond the JDK.
            You'll need to compile and run it yourself though.
