            <b>Game 0</b> - A chromatic tile puzzle game. Playable online <a href="./game0/index.html">here.</a>

            I wrote this in ClojureScript as I wanted an excuse to play with the language.
            I was amazed at how like Clojure it is (apart from the host language interop. and the runtime they're basically identical.)

            <b>Game 1</b> - A cube jousting game. Source code available here: <a href="https://github.com/ourkwest/Cubots">GitHub repository</a>

            I wrote this some years ago as a Java applet (back when Java applets were still a thing).
            There are no dependencies beyond the JDK.
            You'll need to compile and run it yourself though.
